nmap V. 1.60-Beta usage: nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] <host or net #1 ... [#N]>
Scan types
   -sT tcp connect() port scan
   -sS tcp SYN stealth port scan (must be root)
   -sF,-SX, -sN Stealth FIN, Xmas, or Null scan (only works against UNIX).
   -sP ping "scan". Find which hosts on specified network(s) are up but don't 
       port scan them
   -sU UDP port scan, must be r00t
   -b <ftp_relay_host> ftp "bounce attack" port scan
Options (none are required, most can be combined):
   -f use tiny fragmented packets for SYN, FIN, Xmas, or NULL scan.
   -P0 Don't ping hosts (needed to scan www.microsoft.com and others)
   -PT Use "TCP Ping" to see what hosts are up (for normal and ping scans).
   -PT80 Use "TCP Ping" scan with probe destination port of 80 (or whatever).
   -PI Use ICMP ping packet to determines hosts that are up (default for root users)
   -i Get identd (rfc 1413) info on listening TCP processes.
   -p <range> ports: ex: '-p 23' will only try port 23 of the host(s)
                  '-p 20-30,63000-' scans 20-30 and 63000-65535. default: 1-1024
   -D <decoy_host> Make it appear that a scan is also coming from decoy_host.  Even
      if the target detects the scan, they won't know who is scanning them.
   -F fast scan. Only scans ports in /etc/services, a la strobe(1).
   -n Don't DNS resolve anything unless we have to (makes ping scans faster)
   -o <logfile> Output scan logs to <logfile>.
   -g <portnumber> Sets the source port used for scans.  20 and 53 are good choices.
   -L <num> Number of pings to perform in parallel.  Your default is: 52
   -R Try to resolve all hosts, even down ones (can take a lot of time)
   -r do NOT randomize target port scanning order.
   -S <your_IP> If you want to specify the source address of SYN or FYN scan.
   -T <seconds> Set the ping and tcp connect() timeout.
   -v Verbose.  Its use is recommended.  Use twice for greater effect.
   -h help, print this junk.  Also see http://www.insecure.org/nmap/
   -V Print version number and exit.
   -w <n> delay.  n microsecond delay. Not recommended unless needed.
   -M <n> maximum number of parallel sockets.  Larger isn't always better.
   -e <devicename>. Send packets on interface <devicename> (eth0,ppp0,etc.).
   -q quash argv to something benign, currently set to "pine". (deprecated)
Hostnames specified as internet hostname or IP address.  Optional '/mask' specifies subnet. cert.org/24 or 192.88.209.5/24 or 192.88.209.0-255 or '128.88.209.*' scan CERT's Class C.
