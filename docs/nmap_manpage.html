<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>nmap</B> [Scan Type(s)] [Options] &lt;host or net #1 ... [#N]&gt;


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Nmap</I>  is designed to allow system administrators and curi-
       ous individuals to scan large networks to determine  which
       hosts  are  up  and what services they are offering.  <I>nmap</I>
       supports a large number of scanning techniques such as the
       UDP, TCP connect(), TCP SYN (half open), ftp proxy (bounce
       attack), Reverse-ident, ICMP (ping sweep), FIN, Xmas Tree,
       and Null scanning methods.  See the <I>Scan</I> <I>Types</I> section for
       more details.  <I>nmap</I> also offers a number of advanced  fea-
       tures such as stealth scanning, dynamic delay and retrans-
       mission calculations, parallel scanning, detection of down
       hosts  via  parallel  pings, decoy scanning, fragmentation
       scanning, and flexible target and port specification.

       Significant effort has been put into decent  <I>nmap</I>  perfor-
       mance  for  non-root  users.  Unfortunately, many critical
       kernal interfaces (such as raw sockets) require root priv-
       ileges.  <I>nmap</I> should be run as root whenever possible.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       Options  that  make  sense  together can generally be com-
       bined.  Some options are specific to certain  scan  modes.
       <I>nmap</I>  tries  to catch and warn the user about psychotic or
       unsupported option combinations.

       If you are impatient, you can skip to the <I>examples</I> section
       at the end, which demonstrates common usage.  You can also
       run <B>nmap</B> <B>-h</B> for a quick reference  page  listing  all  the
       options.

       <B>Scan</B> <B>Types</B>

       <B>-sT</B>    TCP connect() scan:  This is the most basic form of
              TCP scanning. The connect() system call provided by
              your  operating system is used to open a connection
              to every interesting port on the  machine.  If  the
              port  is  listening, connect() will succeed, other-
              wise the port isn't reachable. One strong advantage
              to  this  technique is that you don't need any spe-
              cial privileges. Any user on  most  UNIX  boxes  is
              free to use this call.

              This  sort  of  scan is easily detectable as target
              host logs will show a bunch of connection and error
              messages  for  the services which accept() the con-
              nection just to have it immediately shutdown.
              as  "half-open"  scanning, because you don't open a
              full TCP connection. You send a SYN packet,  as  if
              you  are  going  to  open a real connection and you
              wait for a response. A SYN|ACK indicates  the  port
              is  listening.  A  RST  is indicative of a non-lis-
              tener.  If a SYN|ACK is received, a RST is  immedi-
              ately  sent  to  tear down the connection (actually
              the OS kernel does this for us). The primary advan-
              tage to this scanning technique is that fewer sites
              will log it.  Unfortunately you  need  root  privi-
              leges to build these custom SYN packets.

       <B>-sF</B> <B>-sX</B> <B>-sN</B>
              Stealth  FIN,  Xmas Tree, or Null scan modes: There
              are times when even SYN scanning isn't  clandestine
              enough. Some firewalls and packet filters watch for
              SYNs to restricted ports, and programs like synlog-
              ger  and  Courtney  are  available  to detect these
              scans. These advanced scans, on the other hand, may
              be able to pass through unmolested.

              The  idea is that closed ports are require to reply
              to your probe packet with an RST, while open  ports
              must ignore the packets in question (see RFC 794 pp
              64).  The FIN  scan  uses  a  bare  (surprise)  FIN
              packet as the probe, while the Xmas tree scan turns
              on the FIN, URG, and PUSH  flags.   The  Null  scan
              turns off all flags.  Unfortunately Microsoft (like
              usual) decided to completely  ignore  the  standard
              and  do  things their own way.  Thus this scan type
              will not work against systems running Windows95/NT.
              On the positive side, this is a good way to distin-
              guish between the two platforms.  If the scan finds
              closed  ports,  you  probably  have a UNIX machine,
              whereas all ports open is indicative of Windows.

       <B>-sP</B>    ICMP Echo scanning: This isn't  really  port  scan-
              ning,  since  ICMP doesn't have a port abstraction.
              But it is sometimes useful to determine what  hosts
              in  a  network  are  up by pinging them all. the -P
              option does this. ICMP scanning is done  in  paral-
              lel,  so  it  can be quite fast. To speed things up
              even more, you can increase the number of pings  in
              parallel  with  the  '-L  '  option. It can also be
              helpful to tweek the ping timeout value with '-T '.

              Note  that  pinging  is done by default anyway, and
              only hosts that respond are scanned.  Only use this
              option  if you wish to ping sweep <B>without</B> doing any
              actual port scans.  You also  might  want  to  look
              into  the  <B>-P</B>  option  for  specifying what type of
              "ping" you wish to use.
              UDP  (User  Datagram  Protocol,  RFC 768) ports are
              open on a host.  The technique is to  send  0  byte
              udp packets to each port on the target machine.  If
              we receive an ICMP port unreachable  message,  then
              the  port  is  closed.   Otherwise  we assume it is
              open.

              Some people think UDP scanning is pointless. I usu-
              ally  remind  them  of  the  recent Solaris rcpbind
              hole. Rpcbind can be found  hiding  on  an  undocu-
              mented  UDP  port  somewhere  above  32770.  So  it
              doesn't matter that 111 is blocked by the firewall.
              But can you find which of the more than 30,000 high
              ports it is listening on? With a  UDP  scanner  you
              can!   There  is  also the cDc Back Orfice backdoor
              programs which hides on a configurable UDP port  on
              Windows  machines.    Not  to mention the many com-
              monly vulnerable services that utilize UDP such  as
              snmp, tftp, NFS, etc.

              Unfortunately  UDP  scanning is sometimes painfully
              slow since most hosts impliment a suggestion in RFC
              1812  (section  4.3.2.8) of limiting the ICMP error
              message rate.  For example, the  Linux  kernel  (in
              net/ipv4/icmp.h)   limits  destination  unreachable
              message generation to 80 per 4 seconds, with a  1/4
              second  penalty  if  that is exceeded.  Solaris has
              much more strict limits (about 2 messages per  sec-
              ond)  and  thus  takes  even  longer to scan.  <I>nmap</I>
              detects this rate limiting and slows  down  accord-
              ingly,  rather  than flood the network with useless
              packets that will be ignored by the target machine.

              As  is typical, Microsoft ignored the suggestion of
              the RFC and does not seem to do any  rate  limiting
              at  all on Win95 and NT machines.  Thus we can scan
              all 65K ports of a Windows  machine  <B>very</B>  quickly.
              Woop!

       <B>-b</B> <B>&lt;ftp</B> <B>relay</B> <B>host&gt;</B>
              FTP  bounce attack: An interesting "feature" of the
              ftp protocol (RFC 959) is support for  "proxy"  ftp
              connections.  In  other  words, I should be able to
              connect from evil.com to the  FTP  server  of  tar-
              get.com  and  request  that  the server send a file
              ANYWHERE on the internet!  Now this may have worked
              well  in  1985  when  the  RFC  was written. But in
              today's Internet, we can't  have  people  hijacking
              ftp servers and requesting that data be spit out to
              arbitrary points on the internet. As *Hobbit* wrote
              back  in  1995,  this protocol flaw "can be used to
              post virtually untraceable mail and news, hammer on
              track  down at the same time." What we will exploit
              this for is to (surprise, surprise) scan TCP  ports
              from  a  "proxy" ftp server. Thus you could connect
              to an ftp server behind a firewall, and  then  scan
              ports  that are more likely to be blocked (139 is a
              good one). If the ftp server  allows  reading  from
              and  writing to some directory (such as /incoming),
              you can send arbitrary data to ports  that  you  do
              find open.

              The  argument  passed to the 'b' option is the host
              you want to use as a proxy, in standard  URL  nota-
              tion.      The     format     is:    <I>username:pass-</I>
              <I>word@server:port.</I>    Everything   but   <I>server</I>   is
              optional.  To determine what servers are vulnerable
              to this attack, you can see my  article  in  <I>Phrack</I>
              51.   And  updated version is available at the <I>nmap</I>
              URL (http://www.insecure.org/nmap).

       <B>General</B> <B>Options</B>
              None of these are required but some  can  be  quite
              useful.

       <B>-P0</B>    Do  not  try  and ping hosts at all before scanning
              them.  This allows the scanning  of  networks  that
              don't  allow  ICMP  echo  requests  (or  responses)
              through their firewall.  microsoft.com is an  exam-
              ple  of  such a network, and thus you should always
              use <B>-P0</B> or <B>-PT80</B> when portscanning microsoft.com.

       <B>-PT</B>    Use TCP "ping" to  determine  what  hosts  are  up.
              Instead  of  sending  ICMP echo request packets and
              waiting for a response, we spew out TCP  SYN  (con-
              nection request) packets throughout the target net-
              work (or to a single machine)  and  then  wait  for
              responses  to  trickle  back.   Hosts  that  are up
              should respond with a RST (or, rarely, a  SYN|ACK).
              This  option preserves the efficiency of only scan-
              ning hosts that are up while still allowing you  to
              scan  networks/hosts that block ping packets.  This
              is also very useful because it can be done by  non-
              root  users.   To  set  the destination port of the
              probe  packets  use  -PT&lt;port  number&gt;.   Sometimes
              ports like 80 are much more useful than the default
              anonymous high port  due  to  filtering,  so  using
              -PT80 can help.


       <B>-PI</B>    This  is  the  default  ping  type (for root users)
              which uses a true ping (ICMP echo request)  packet.
              It  finds hosts that are up and also looks for sub-
              net-directed broadcast addresses on  your  network.
              IP  packets to a subnet of computers.  These should
              be eliminated if found as they allow  for  numerous
              denial  of  service attacks (Smurf is the most com-
              mon).

       <B>-i</B>     This turns on TCP reverse ident scanning. As  noted
              by Dave Goldsmith in a 1996 Bugtraq post, the ident
              protocol (rfc 1413) allows for  the  disclosure  of
              the  username  that  owns any process connected via
              TCP, even if that process didn't initiate the  con-
              nection.  So  you  can, for example, connect to the
              http port and then use identd to find  out  whether
              the  server  is  running  as root. This can only be
              done with a full TCP connection to the target  port
              (i.e.  the  -sT scanning option).  When <B>-i</B> is used,
              the remote hosts identd is queried  for  each  open
              port  found.  Obviously this won't work if the host
              is not running identd.

       <B>-f</B>     This option causes the requested SYN, FIN, XMAS, or
              NULL  scan  to use tiny fragmented IP packets.  The
              idea is to split up the  TCP  header  over  several
              packets to make it harder for packet filters and so
              forth to detect what you are doing. Be careful with
              this!  Some  programs  have  trouble handling these
              tiny  packets.  My  favorite  sniffer  segmentation
              faulted   immediately   upon  receiving  the  first
              36-byte fragment. After that comes a 24  byte  one!
              While  this  method won't get by packet filters and
              firewalls that queue all  IP  fragments  (like  the
              CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG option in Linux), some net-
              works can't afford the performance hit this  causes
              and thus leave it disabled.

              Note  that I do not yet have this option working on
              all systems.  It works fine for my Linux boxes  and
              some  people  have reported success with other *NIX
              variants.

       <B>-v</B>     Verbose mode.  This is a highly recommended  option
              and  it  gives  out  more information about what is
              going on.  You can use it twice for greater effect.
              Use  <B>-d</B> a couple of times if you really want to get
              crazy with scrolling the screen!

       <B>-h</B>     This handy option display a quick reference  screen
              of nmap usage options.

       <B>-o</B> <B>&lt;logfilename&gt;</B>
              This  logs  the results of your scans into the file
              you specify as an argument.

              This option specifies what ports you want to  spec-
              ify.  For  example '-p 23' will only try port 23 of
              the target host(s).  ports greater than 60000.  The
              default is to scan all ports between 1 and 1024.

       <B>-F</B> <B>Fast</B> <B>scan</B> <B>mode.</B>
              Specifies  that  you  only  wish  to scan for ports
              listed in /etc/services.  This  is  obviously  much
              faster than scanning all 65535 ports on a host.

       <B>-D</B> <B>&lt;hostname</B> <B>or</B> <B>IP</B> <B>address&gt;</B>
              Causes  a decoy scan to be performed which makes it
              appear to the remote host that the host you specify
              is  scanning  the target network.  You can use this
              option numerous times to make it appear  that  many
              different   machines   are   scanning   the  target
              addresses.  Then  even  if  the  administrators  <B>do</B>
              detect  your stealth scan, they will see 5 or 10 of
              them and will not have any idea which of the  hosts
              were  actually scanning them and which were decoys.

              Note that the hosts you use as decoys should be  up
              or  you  might  accidently  SYN flood your targets.
              Also it will be pretty easy to determine which host
              is  scanning if only one is actually up on the net-
              work.

              Also note that some (stupid) "port scan  detectors"
              will  firewall/deny  routing  to hosts that attempt
              port scans.  Thus you might inadvertantly cause the
              machine  you  scan  to  lose  connectivity with the
              decoy machines you are using.  This could cause the
              target  machines  major  problems  if the decoy is,
              say, its  internet  gateway  or  even  "localhost".
              Thus  you  might want to be careful of this option.
              The real moral of the story is  that  detectors  of
              spoofable port scans should not take action against
              the machine that seems like  it  is  port  scanning
              them!

              This  option  is  only available for FIN,SYN, Xmas,
              and ICMP ping scans.

       <B>-S</B> <B>&lt;IP_Address&gt;</B>
              In some circumstances, <I>nmap</I>  may  not  be  able  to
              determine  your source address ( <I>nmap</I> will tell you
              if this is the case).  In this  situation,  use  -S
              with  your IP address (of the interface you wish to
              send packets through).

              Another possible use of this flag is to  spoof  the
              scan to make the targets think that <B>someone</B> <B>else</B> is
              ported usage (or the main purpose) of this flag.  I
              just  think  it  raises  an interesting possibility
              that people should  be  aware  of  before  they  go
              accusing  others  of  port scanning them.  <B>-e</B> would
              generally be required for this sort of usage.

       <B>-e</B> <B>&lt;interface&gt;</B>
              Tells nmap what interface to send and receive pack-
              ets  on.  Nmap should be able to detect this but it
              will tell you if it cannot.

       <B>-g</B> <B>&lt;portnumber&gt;</B>
              Sets the source port number used  in  scans.   Many
              naive firewall and packet filter installations make
              an exception in their ruleset to allow DNS (53)  or
              FTP-DATA  (20) packets come through and establish a
              connection.  Obviously this completely subverts the
              security advantages of the firewall since intruders
              can just masquerade as  FTP  or  DNS  by  modifying
              their  source  port.   Obviously for a UDP scan you
              should try 53 first and TCP  scans  should  try  20
              before 53.

              Be  aware that there is a small performance penalty
              on some scans for  using  this  option,  because  I
              sometimes  store  useful  information in the source
              port number.

       <B>Target</B> <B>specification</B>
              Everything that isn't an option  (or  option  argu-
              ment)  in nmap is treated as a target host specifi-
              cation.  The simplest case is listing single  host-
              names  or IP addresses on the command line.  If you
              want to scan a subnet  of  IP  addresses,  you  can
              append <B>'/mask'</B> to the hostname or IP address.  <B>mask</B>
              must be between 0 (scan the whole internet) and  32
              (scan  the single host specified).  Use /24 to scan
              a class 'C' address and /16 for a class 'B'.

              Nmap also has a more powerful notation  which  lets
              you  specify  an  IP address using lists/ranges for
              each element.  Thus you can scan  the  whole  class
              'B' network 128.210.*.* by specifying '128.210.*.*'
              or       '128.210.0-255.0-255'       or        even
              '128.210.1-50,51-255.1,2,3,4,5-255'.  And of course
              you can use the  mask  notation:  '128.210.0.0/16'.
              These  are  all  equivalent.   If you use astericts
              ('*'), remember that most  shells  require  you  to
              escape  them with back slashes or protect them with
              quotes.

              Another interesting thing to do is slice the Inter-
              every  IP  address  that ends in .5.6 or .5.7  Pick
              your own numbers.  For more information on specify-
              ing hosts to scan, see the <I>examples</I> section.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       Here are some examples of using nmap, from simple and nor-
       mal to a little more complex/esoteric.  Note  that  actual
       numbers  and  some  actual  domain  names are used to make
       things more concrete.  In their place you  should  substi-
       tute  addresses/names  from  <B>your</B>  <B>own</B>  <B>network.</B>  I do not
       think portscanning other networks is illegal;  nor  should
       portscans  be  construed  by  others as an attack.  I have
       scanned hundreds of thousands of machines and  nobody  has
       ever  complained.   But  I am not a lawyer and some (anal)
       people may be annoyed  by  <I>nmap</I>  probes.   Get  permission
       first or use at your own risk.

       <B>nmap</B> <B>-v</B> <B>target.example.com</B>

       This  option  scans  all reserved TCP ports on the machine
       target.example.com .  The -v means turn on verbose mode.

       <B>nmap</B> <B>-sS</B> <B>target.example.com/24</B>

       Launches a stealth SYN scan against each machine  that  is
       up out of the 255 machines on class 'C' where target.exam-
       ple.com resides.  This requires root privileges because of
       the SYN scan.

       <B>nmap</B> <B>-sX</B> <B>-p</B> <B>22,53,110,143,4564</B> <B>128.210.*.1-127</B>

       Sends  an  Xmas tree scan to the first half of each of the
       255 possible 8  bit  subnets  in  the  128.210  class  'B'
       address  space.   We  are  testing whether the systems run
       sshd, DNS, pop3d, imapd, or  port  4564.   The  latter  is
       included  to filter out Windows boxes, which will show all
       ports open (Xmas scan doesn't work on Microsoft boxes  due
       to  their  deficient  TCP  stack).  Thus any machines that
       show port 4564 can be marked down under 'Windows boxes'.

       <B>nmap</B> <B>-v</B> <B>-p</B> <B>80</B> <B>'*.*.2.3-5'</B>

       Rather than focus in a specific IP range, it is  sometimes
       interesting  to  take  the entire Internet and try a small
       sample of  each  section.   This  command  finds  all  web
       servers  on  machines  with  IP  addresses ending in .2.3,
       .2.4, or .2.5 .  If you are root you  might  as  well  add
       -sS.   Also you will find more interesting machines start-
       ing at 127. so you might want to use '127-222' instead  of
       the first asterict because that section has a greater den-
       sity of interesting machines (IMHO).
       <B>53,80,139</B> <B>-o</B> <B>logs/evil_empire.scan</B> <B>www.microsoft.com/24</B>

       This  SYN scans 255 machines on the www.microsoft.com net-
       work of web servers looking for  TCP  ports  53  (DNS)  80
       (WWW)  and  139  (NetBIOS-SSN).  We use <B>-PT80</B> because that
       network does not allow pings, so we use TCP ping  instead.
       We  also  need  the '80' because SYN packets to most other
       ports are blocked by  their  firewall.   We  use  <B>-g</B>  <B>6791</B>
       because  the  source port of the scan must be greater than
       1023.  Packets  coming  from  privileged  ports  are  also
       dropped at the MS firewall.  The <B>-D</B> option makes it appear
       (to MS) that 'lamer.example.com' is scanning them  at  the
       same  time  we are.  MS won't know which is doing the real
       scan and which is the decoy.  The <B>-o</B> option logs important
       output to logs/evil_empire.scan for our later perusal.

       Most domains are not this much of a pain to scan.  MS just
       has a paranoid-as-hell packet filtering policy.   This  is
       actually  quite  prudent given that they must secure thou-
       sands of hopelessly insecure NT boxes!  For more  info  on
       MS   insecurity,   see   my   page   on   the  subject  at
       <I>http://www.insecure.org/sploits.html.</I>

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       <I>nmap</I> is still not as portable as I would like.   IP  frag-
       mentation support is especially limited in portability.
