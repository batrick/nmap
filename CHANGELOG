# Nmap Changelog

***Version 2.05 Changes***

-- Tons of new fingerprints.  The number has grown by more than 25%.
  In particular, Charles M. Hannum <root@ihack.net> fixed several
  problems with NetBSD that made it easy to fingerprint and he sent me
  a huge new batch of fingerprints for various NetBSD releases down to
  1.2.  Other people sent NetBSD fingerprints down to 1.0.  I finally
  got some early Linux fingerprints in (down to 1.09).

-- Nmap now comes with its own nmap.services which I created by
   merging the /etc/services from a bunch of OS' and then adding
   Netbus, Back Orifice, etc.

-- Random number generation now takes advantage of the /dev/urandom or
   /dev/random that most free operating systems offer.

-- Increased the maximum number of OS guesses nmap will make, told
   nmap never to give you two matches where the OS names are
   byte-to-byte equivalent.  Fixed nmap to differentiate between "no
   OS matches found" and "too many OS matches to list".


-- Fixed an information leak in the packet TTL values (found by 
   HD Moore <hdmoore@usa.net>)

-- Fixed the problem noted by Savva Uspensky about offsets used for
   various operating systems' PPP/SLIP headers.  Due to lack of
   responses regarding other operating systems, I have made
   assumptions about what works for BSDI, NetBSD, and SOLARIS.  If
   this version no longer works on your modem, please let me know (and
   tell me whether you are using SLIP/PPP and what OS you are
   running).

-- Machine parseable logs are now more machine parseable (I now use a
   tab to seperate test result fields rather than the more ambiguous
   spaces.  This may break a few things which rely on the old format.
   Sorry.  They should be easy to fix.

-- Added my nmap-fingerprintinting-article.txt to the distribution in
   the docs directory.

-- Added a CHANGELOG file to the distribution.

-- Fixed problem where nmap -sS <my_ethernet_or_ppp_ip_address> would
   not correctly scan localhost (due to the kernel rerouting the
   traffic through localhost).  Nmap should now detect and work around
   this behavior.

-- Applied patch sent to my by Bill Fenner <fenner@parc.xerox.com>
   which fixes various SunOS compatibility problems.

-- Changed the makefile 'all' target to use install-sh rather than 
   mkdir -p (doesn't work on some systems)

-- Documentation updated and clarified slightly.

-- Regarding someone's post that nmap should include firewall firewall
   fingerprints -- I'm happy to include them when people send them
   in.  I think I added 3 firewall fingerprints last night.
