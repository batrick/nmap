%description
Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It
supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port
scanning techniques (determine what services the hosts are offering),
and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host operating system
identification). Nmap also offers flexible target and port
specification, decoy scanning, determination of TCP sequence
predictability characteristics, sunRPC scanning, reverse-identd
scanning, and more.

%changelog
* Thu Dec 30 1999 Fyodor <fyodor@dhp.com>
- Updated description
- Eliminated source1 (nmapfe.desktop) directive and simply packaged it with Nmap
- Fixed nmap distribution URL (source0)
- Added this .rpm to base Nmap distribution

* Mon Dec 13 1999 Tim Powers <timp@redhat.com>
- based on origional spec file from
	http://www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html#download
- general cleanups, removed lots of commenrts since it made the spec hard to
	read
- changed group to Applications/System
- quiet setup
- no need to create dirs in the install section, "make
	prefix=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT&{prefix} install" does this.
- using defined %{prefix}, %{version} etc. for easier/quicker maint.
- added docs
- gzip man pages
- strip after files have been installed into buildroot
- created separate package for the frontend so that Gtk+ isn't needed for the
	CLI nmap 
- not using -f in files section anymore, no need for it since there aren't that
	many files/dirs
- added desktop entry for gnome
